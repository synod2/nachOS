# nachOS 

An assignment from NCU - operation system course

This repository is to build the nachOS in docker

Environment is i386/ubuntu 14.04

type `docker build nachOS -t tag`, anything done.


### P.S. 
`nachos-4.0.tar.gz`,`nachos-lib.tar` is fiddled by our TA, 
If you want to change these install files, just modified the command after 14~17 line in Dockerfile.
